### About
I am a physician-scientist who specializes in the care of patients with obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. After completing my training in Psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and McLean Hospital, I joined the faculty at MGH and Harvard Medical School (HMS), where I provide clinical care, supervise trainees, administer a clinic, and conduct research on obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) to enhance our knowledge and the quality of patient care. My roles at MGH and HMS comprise a combination of clinical care, teaching, and research.

My clinical interests and expertise revolve around the practice of adult outpatient and inpatient psychiatry. I am actively involved in clinical work, providing treatment for patients afflicted with obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. I work closely with colleagues in the Center for OCD and Related Disorders (CORD) at MGH, along with close collaboration with members of the OCD Institute at McLean Hospital.

My research interests lie in the nosology of psychiatric illness. I employ computational approaches for behavioral classification, genomic studies, neuroimaging, and cognitive tasks in patients with OCD, with a goal to both improve our understanding of this disorder and enhance clinical care in both psychopharmacology and psychotherapy.

Through my lecturing (at a local, regional, and national level), my written works (e.g., peer-reviewed original research, topical reviews of the literature, and book chapters in well-regard texts), my clinical research, and my involvement with professional societies I have sought to improve the care for patients with all psychiatric illnesses, focusing primarily on obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.
