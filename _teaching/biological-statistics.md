**Course Level**: Graduate

**Prerequisites**: None

**Description**: Statistical analysis remains integral to scientific research, yet it is far too often contemplated only after data have been collected. Here we delve into the foundations of statistical methods within the context of biology. Students will learn basic principles of statistics, probability, parametric and non-parametric hypothesis testing, linear and nonlinear regression, and a few special topics. To solidify this knowledge, biweekly course lectures shall be integrated with weekly problem sets. In doing so, students will grasp not only the basic principles of statistical methods, but they will also learn how to perform these techniques by hand. The course does not require that students possess a strong background in mathematics; however, students should be prepared to complete problem sets that may incorporate mathematical derivations. Any questions regarding the course should be directed to the course instructor.

**Offering**: This course was taught to graduate students at The Rockefeller University and Weill Cornell Medical College. **Future course offerings in the Harvard community are pending.**
